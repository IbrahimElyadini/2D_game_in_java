# 2D Game Project in Java 🎮

## 📖 About the Project
This is a simple **2D game** built as part of my journey to learn Java and game development. The project helps me explore topics such as:
- Tile-based maps
- Sprite animations
- Player movement
- Basic gameplay mechanics
- camera 
- etc.

## 🕹️ How to Run the Game

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IbrahimElyadini/2D_game_in_java.git
   cd 2d-java-game
2. **The program was used with IntellijIdea**:
   compatibility issues may arise with other IDEs such as ecplise until the game gets put into an executable file.
3. **If you are using IntellijIdea**:
   The res folder needs to be marked as a Ressource root for the sprites and tiles to be found by the compiler.
